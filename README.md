# MineSweeper
Minesweeper Game in Java 

This project is a classic Minesweeper game implemented in Java. The game offers two variations:

  1. 10x10 Grid: 10 mines
  2. 15x15 Grid: 20 mines
     
Players can reveal cells, flag potential mines, and navigate the grid to avoid detonating any mines. The grid and mines are dynamically initialized based on the selected difficulty.
